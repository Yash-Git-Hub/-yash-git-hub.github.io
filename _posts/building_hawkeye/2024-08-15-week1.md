Day 1-7: Project Setup and Initial Development
## Day 1: Setting Up Hawkeye

Hey everyone, on day one my basic aim is to research what I am going to pen down, jot down my feelings, and think about this. I am thinking of using FastAPI for the backend because I have never used it before, and I consider it should not be too heavy when it comes to backend development.

### Frameworks and Tools 
- Backend: FastAPI for the API
- Frontend: Streamlit (I chose Streamlit because it looks good, and for an MVP, I believe frontend aesthetics are not critical. We can focus on backend functionality and scale up to something more robust and visually appealing later on.)
- Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite for storing video data and analysis results (I prefer PostgreSQL due to my familiarity with the Tortoise wrapper, which should facilitate better interaction. I still need to finalize the database design.)
- Cloud Storage: AWS S3 (I can set up a local stack to mirror AWS S3)
- Deployment: Docker for containerization, AWS EC2 (local stack supremacy)

Today, I made progress by setting up my GitHub repository, pushing my requirements, and establishing a basic file structure. I faced some challenges because I just bought a new MacBook Pro M3, so I had to install Python and everything from scratch, but it was fairly easy. I've also created a `requirements.txt` that will help in setting up and Dockerizing later. My next steps involve setting up the basic application.
